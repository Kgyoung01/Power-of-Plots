1) There is a positive correlation between average mouse weight and average tumor volume where the heavier the mouse, the more likely for that mouse to have a higher tumor volume as this was confirmed in the correlation and linear regression model.

2) The sex distribution between male/female is almost equally split regarding drug testing.
.
3) Ramicane seems to be the most effective in reducing tumor growth, having the lowest mean, median, variance and standard deviation.
